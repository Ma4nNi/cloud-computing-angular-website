      "value":15,
      "answer":"This article by Martin Fowler talks about the benefits and drawbacks that come with a microservices architecture when comparing it to a monolithic architecture. He argues that module boundaries are easier to implement with a microservices architecture than with monoliths because of the nature of the project. That since concerns are separated and isolated deployment and updates are simpler with microservices. And since every module is independent that means you can do every part with the technologies that are the most convenient for them. - with microservices .However everything comes with drawbacks, in this case with microservices you don’t get real time consistency as you might with monoliths, you get eventual consistency - in distributed systems. Also with a microservices architecture you need to keep constant changes on different services, which means you need more people specialized in maintaining everything running smoothly, the fact that each module can work when one is down doesn’t mean that it’s ok for anything to fail.

      "text":"Read at least 5 sections of Seth Godin’s Manifesto: “Stop Stealing Dreams” and tell me what you think about it.",
      "value":"10",
      "answer":"I read sections 15-20. I don’t agree with the point of view he has in respect of others aspirations. I think it’s ok to aspire to assist someone to do something important, as long as they want to help make a difference I don’t think it’s wrong that they don’t want to be in the spotlight. The rest of the text is what really made me think.  Reinventing the school system is something that I really want to see happen, and it’s a problem the people in my field can actually impact. It can go from very simple stuff with platforms like codeacademy, udemy, udacity, etc. To applying some kind of AI to aid teachers with how to teach, grade, etc.  On a more personal note, I recently started taking some classes in UABC and I was unpleasantly surprised that they don’t let you use any kind of electronics while in some parts of the school. Even though I realize they do that to prevent some kind of misbehavior by their students, I think this is more akin to resisting change, instead they should teach them how to fully make use of technology in order to aid our learning.  The final section talked about dreams, and I agree completely with that part. When I was a child I wanted to be an astronomer, a physician and a mathematician to be someone who discovered something important for our civilization. I shared these dreams with my parents only to be told in different occasions  that I’d only die from hunger if i pursued those professions,  that I should instead be a Physician or Politician. I really hate the idea of telling others they shouldn’t pursue a career in a certain field just because few people thrive in it. So, to sum it up, I agree with what he says in that we should change how schools work atm and that we shouldn’t destroy dreams in order for them to have a “steady” job."
