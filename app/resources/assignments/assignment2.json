      "answer":"Is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Each of these services should also be independently deployable. There shouldn’t be much centralized management.\nMost microservices architectures aim to automate deployment of these services and also include automated tests. Relating to this last point, a key on microservices design  is being able to design for failure. Every component should be able to tolerate the failure of any other service."

      "answer":"The routes in Angular help link the view and the controllers. It watches location.url() and maps the path to an existing route definition.\nInternally $route uses $template. The goals of angular routing involve no page refresh on page change and having different data on each page. When you declare a new route you include an associated view/template and a controller.\nNow, talking about the $template functionality: the first time the template is accessed, angular will get it from the server and add it to the $templateCache. In simpler(my) words: the route specifies which components or files are gonna be loaded, and Angular makes everything lighter by using the cache to store files that were already loaded but are needed  in multiple views."

And I'm trying to research as best as I can how to do a proper architecture for the projects we're planning."
