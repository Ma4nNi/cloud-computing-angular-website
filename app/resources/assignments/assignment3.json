      "answer":"Basically because computers are everywhere now, we have our phones, laptops, smart tvs, smart watches, etc. Pretty much any service or company that wants to thrive needs to be accessible by the internet.  Cloud computing allows ANYONE to be able to deliver their services in such a way without having to spend the thousands or millions of dollars that were needed before. It also allows your business to scale as you grow, it enables you to only focus on what you actually provide instead of having to worry about extra things like maintaining hardware, buying infrastructure, etc."

      "answer": "While I certainly enjoy this class better than most I've had I'd make some adjustments to the classes where we do scripts as a group.I'd like it if maybe we started the class with some base code that you gave us beforehand, maybe just tell us the file structure and which libraries to install or some links to the documentation. If you'd tell us to do some pre work for Tuesdays class I think things would be less chaotic. The other type of sessions I find them pretty great."
